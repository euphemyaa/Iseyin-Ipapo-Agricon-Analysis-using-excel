## 6. Insights  
**1.	Farmer Demographics:** Majority are small and medium-scale farmers due to limited capital and land ownership constraints.  
**2.	Regional Concentration:** 70% of responses came from the South West Nigeria, likely due to favorable conditions and better survey outreach.  
**3.	Lack of Services:** 78% of farmers lack access to basic agricultural services s due to low awareness, inadequate extension agents, and potential trust issues with external providers.  
**4.	Technology Access:** 75% own smartphones, but only 50% use the internet; strong preference for USSD due to cost, ease, or literacy.  
**5.	Crop Prioritization:** Maize, cassava, and tomatoes are the most cultivated crops, driven by local dietary needs, market demand, and climate; tomatoes may require more resources.  
**6.	Infrastructure Deficiency:** Electricity and cold storage are major gaps, 60%+ lack access to cold rooms/processing plants; 51%+ spoilage rates due to poor rural electrification, lack of capital, weak logistics, and limited public private partnerships.  
**7.	Regional Crop Differences:**  
           **South West:**  
o	Maize leads, followed by tomatoes and cassava, with yam the least cultivated.  
o	This is likely due to favorable climatic conditions, market demand, and better access to inputs like fertilizers and irrigation. The region’s relatively developed infrastructure supports higher-value crops like tomatoes.  
                **South East:**  
o	Tomatoes are not cultivated, while maize, cassava, and yam dominate.  
o	Tomatoes may be absent due to higher susceptibility to pests and diseases in humid conditions or lack of irrigation infrastructure. Cassava and maize are more resilient and better aligned with local diets and practices.  
             **South South:**  
o	Cassava and yam dominate, maize is barely grown.  
o	The region's heavy rainfall and swampy conditions favor root crops like cassava and yam over cereals like maize, which struggle with excess water and poor drainage.  
            **North Central:**
o	Even crop distribution, but yam is the least cultivated.  
o	The moderate climate supports a range of crops. Yam’s lower ranking could be due to land or labor intensity, making other crops more attractive.  
            **North East:**  
o	All crops are cultivated in similar proportions.  
o	This may reflect subsistence farming practices and diverse dietary needs. However, underlying factors like conflict, limited access to inputs, or generalized low adoption of commercial farming could result in uniform but low-scale cultivation across crops.  

**8.	Spoilage:** 26–50% crop spoilage most reported which maybe due to Poor post-harvest infrastructure (lack of cold rooms, dryers, processing plants), Delayed access to markets or Inadequate storage facilities and preservation knowledge.  
**9.	Storage:** 54% have no storage access which may be due to High cost of building or renting storage, Limited availability of shared storage facilities or even Inadequate infrastructure in rural areas.  
**10.	Willingness to Pay:** 59% prefer subscriptions; 22% pay-per-use  
## 7. Recommendations  
**1.	Farmer-Focused Interventions**  
                   – Tailor programs and app features specifically to small- and medium-scale farmers.   
                   – Design affordable pricing models, support systems, and services based on their
